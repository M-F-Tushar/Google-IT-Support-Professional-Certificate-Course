**How to Count in Binary**

Binary is the fundamental language of computers, used not just for text and images but also in areas like networking and security. Understanding how binary numbers work is essential for anyone working with computers.

### The Basics of Binary Counting
Binary operates with only two digits:
- **0** (OFF) 💡
- **1** (ON) 🔆

Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2, much like how decimal numbers use powers of 10.

### Example of Binary Counting
| Decimal | Binary  |
|---------|---------|
| 0       | 0000    |
| 1       | 0001    |
| 2       | 0010    |
| 3       | 0011    |
| 4       | 0100    |

### How It Works 🖥️
- Start at **0**.
- Each step increases the value, flipping bits as needed.
- When all bits are **1**, adding one more resets them to **0** and carries over (just like 9+1 in decimal gives 10).

### Why Binary Matters 🚀
Understanding binary is crucial for fields like:
- **Computer Networking** 🌐
- **Cybersecurity** 🔒
- **Programming & IT Support** 🖥️
