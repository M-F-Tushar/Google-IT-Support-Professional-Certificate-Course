# 💻 Virtual Machines: Unlocking the Power of Multiple OS 🌐

## Introduction
Before we start installing our operating system, let's get familiar with the concept of virtual machines (VMs). A virtual machine is essentially a copy of a real machine. But why would you need one? 🤔

## Why Use Virtual Machines? 💡
We've been working with physical machines so far, but in IT support, there are times when you need access to a machine that isn't physically in front of you. For example:
- If you have a Windows machine but want to learn Linux, you might not want to buy another computer or have two separate operating systems on your disk. Instead, you can use an application like VirtualBox to install Linux and keep it completely isolated from your machine. 🖥️

### Benefits of Virtual Machines 🌟
- **Utilize Physical Resources**: VMs use physical resources like memory, CPU, and storage.
- **Run Multiple OS**: You can run multiple operating systems at once.
- **Easy Maintenance and Provisioning**: VMs are easier to maintain and provision compared to physical machines.
- **On-Demand Creation**: Create new virtual computers on-demand, reclaiming resources when no longer needed.
- **Software-Specific Use**: Use software available on a specific OS, then delete the VM once done.

## Hands-On Exercises with VMs 🛠️
Throughout this program, you'll use VMs to perform hands-on exercises. You'll be working on our Quick Labs platform, where you'll be presented with tasks to complete within a lab setting. 
- **Task Completion**: We list out the specific tasks you'll need to complete. Once you complete them, you'll get credit for the lab. 🏅

## Conclusion
Now that you understand what a virtual machine is, you can see how incredibly useful they can be in IT support and beyond. Happy virtualizing! 🚀
