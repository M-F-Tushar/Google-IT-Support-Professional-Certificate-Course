### What is Computer Hardware?
Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer, each playing a crucial role in its operation:
- **Central Processing Unit (CPU) 🧠** – The brain of the computer that processes instructions and executes tasks.
- **Memory (RAM) ⚡** – Temporary storage that allows the CPU to quickly access and process data.
- **Storage (HDD/SSD) 💾** – Permanent storage for the operating system, applications, and files.
- **Motherboard 🖧** – The main circuit board connecting and facilitating communication between all components.
- **Power Supply Unit (PSU) 🔌** – Converts electricity into usable power for the computer.
- **Input Devices ⌨️🖱️** – Keyboards, mice, and touchscreens that allow users to interact with the system.
- **Output Devices 🖥️🖨️** – Monitors, printers, and speakers that display or output information.
