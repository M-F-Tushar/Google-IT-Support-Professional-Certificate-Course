**⚡ Understanding Power Supplies**

A power supply is a crucial component of a computer that provides the necessary electrical energy to run all internal components efficiently.

### 🔌 What is a Power Supply?
- Converts electricity from a **wall outlet** into a form usable by the computer.
- Supplies power to all internal components like the **CPU, motherboard, GPU, and storage devices**.
- Ensures **stable and regulated voltage** to prevent damage to hardware.

### ⚡ Types of Electrical Current
1. **AC (Alternating Current) 🔄** – The type of electricity supplied by power companies; changes direction periodically.
2. **DC (Direct Current) ➡️** – The type of electricity used by computers; flows in one direction.

### 🔋 How a Power Supply Works
- Converts **AC power** from the wall into **DC power** for computer components.
- Distributes power through different voltage rails (e.g., **12V, 5V, 3.3V**).
- Uses **fans and heatsinks** to prevent overheating. ❄️

### ⚙️ Choosing the Right Power Supply
- Measured in **watts (W) 🔢** – Determines how much power it can provide.
- **Efficiency rating** (e.g., 80 PLUS) – Indicates how much power is wasted as heat. 🔥
- Must match the **power needs of the system** to avoid underpowering or overpowering components. ⚖️

### ✅ Final Thoughts
A reliable power supply ensures system stability and longevity. Choosing the right one prevents power failures, overheating, and performance issues.
